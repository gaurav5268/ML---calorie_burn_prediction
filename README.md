# Calorie Burn Prediction

This project predicts the number of calories burned during physical exercise using a machine learning model built with XGBoost. The app provides an intuitive Streamlit-based UI, and is fully containerized using Docker for easy deployment.

## How the Model Works

The model is trained on a dataset containing exercise physiological parameters and corresponding calorie burn values.
It uses:

XGBoost Regression

Train/Test Split

Performance metrics like MAE, RMSE, R² Score

Saved using .json to ensure compatibility across XGBoost versions

## Technologies Used

Python

XGBoost

NumPy

Pandas

Scikit-Learn

Streamlit

Docker
